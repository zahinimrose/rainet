# rainet

## Simple game logic implementation of RaiNet AccessBattlers, an in-universe game in the Steins; Gate franchise.

It is a simple prototype made for educational purposes. Not ready for serious gameplay. The terminal UI is ugly and tedious to test. Does not implement terminal cards. Does not have proper error handling.
