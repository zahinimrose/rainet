# rainet

## Simple game logic implementation of RaiNet AccessBattlers, an in-universe game in the Steins; Gate franchise.

Game logic is contained in game.c and the interface is in game.h . control.c handles input and trender.c renders the game in the terminal.
It is a simple prototype made for educational purposes. Not ready for serious gameplay. The terminal UI is ugly and tedious to test. Does not implement terminal cards. Does not have proper error handling.
